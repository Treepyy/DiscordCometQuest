# DiscordCometQuest

Simple program within an emulated directory for the comet browser to trick Discord into finishing the 5000 orbs quest without actually installing the comet browser.

Steps:
- Clone the repo
- Run "comet.exe" (make sure it is still in the same directory, when Discord detects you as playing "Comet" then this step is sucessful)
- Wait for program to finish counting down for the quest to finish
- ???
- Profit
